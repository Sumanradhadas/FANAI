🎯 FanAI Token & Campaign System Overview
💰 Token Pricing

Each image generation costs: 10 tokens

User token rate: 10 tokens = ₹5

Users can purchase tokens at this rate (via payment gateway — coming soon).

🆓 Free Trial

Every new user receives 20 free tokens automatically to test the platform before making any purchase.

📸 Campaigns

Campaigns allow celebrities, creators, or brands to run special promotions with exclusive templates for fans.

Campaign Setup & Pricing

Minimum campaign: ₹10,000

For every ₹10,000, the campaign receives 25,000 tokens

Campaign templates are exclusive — available only on that celebrity’s campaign page.

Fans can use these templates for free as long as campaign tokens remain.

How Campaigns Work

Campaigns cannot be purchased directly through the website.
Interested celebrities, managers, or promoters must contact us via email to start a campaign.

Once approved, the admin sets up the campaign manually through the admin panel:

Uploads exclusive templates

Adds the celebrity’s campaign details

Allocates the campaign’s 25,000 tokens (or more if needed)

As users generate photos on the campaign page, the campaign token balance decreases automatically.

When the campaign tokens run out, users can continue generating by using their personal tokens at normal rates.

🧾 Credits & Security

Every image generation request is linked to either:

The user’s personal balance, or

The campaign’s shared balance (if generating from a campaign page).

All token balances are stored securely in the database, not on the client side.

Tokens can only be added, deducted, or modified through authenticated server-side operations or admin actions.

Admin panel provides full control for:

Creating and managing campaigns

Allocating additional campaign tokens

Monitoring token usage and campaign stats

🔐 Security Features

No client-side token editing — balances are protected by the backend.

Atomic transactions ensure no double spending.

Audit logs track all token activities (user, campaign, admin).

Admin-only top-ups prevent unauthorized token inflation.

Each new user’s 20 trial tokens are granted by the server automatically upon registration.

📩 Campaign Onboarding Flow

A celebrity or promoter sends a request to:
📧 fanai.partners@gmail.com
 (example — use your real one)

Admin reviews and approves the campaign.

Admin uses the Admin Panel to:

Create the campaign

Upload templates & images

Set initial campaign token allocation (e.g., 25,000 tokens for ₹10,000)

Publish the campaign page

🧠 Example Scenario

Campaign: “Welcome to my new movie launch”

Setup: ₹10,000 → 25,000 campaign tokens

Fans can visit the campaign page → select exclusive Akshay templates → generate photos for free (using campaign tokens).
